        <li>Mix instant chocolate pudding mix into whipped topping; spread half the mixture over peanut butter layer.</li>
        <li>Spread half the peanut butter cups over whipped topping layer.</li>
        <li>Remove tops of hot fudge and caramel topping jars and microwave on low power for about 10 seconds at a time, just until toppings are warmed and liquid. Drizzle half of the fudge and caramel sauces over peanut butter cups.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, starting with remaining ice cream sandwiches, followed by remaining peanut butter, whipped topping mix, peanut butter cups, hot fudge sauce, and caramel sauce.</li>
        <li>Freeze dessert until solidly frozen, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
